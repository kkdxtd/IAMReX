## Overview

IAMReX is a fork of the original [IAMR](https://github.com/AMReX-Fluids/IAMR) codebase that extends its capabilities for simulating multiphase incompressible flows and fluid-structure interaction problems on both CPUs and GPUs with/without subcycling. 

**Key additions to IAMR include:**
- **Level Set (LS) method** for capturing gas-liquid interfaces with reinitialization schemes
- **Multidirect forcing Immersed Boundary Method (IBM)** for resolving fluid-solid interfaces
- **Particle collision algorithms** with Discrete Element Method (DEM) and adaptive collision time model (ACTM) for particle-wall and particle-particle interactions

## Comparison with Base IAMR

| Feature | IAMR | IAMReX |
|---------|------|--------|
| State Variables | 4 (velocity, density, tracers, temperature) | 5 (adds level set) |
| Interface Methods | None | Level set, immersed boundary, phase field (TBD) |
| Particle Support | None | Full 6-DOF dynamics with collisions |
| Multi-Physics | Single-phase only | Multi-phase, fluid-solid interaction |
| Collision Detection | None | Spatial hashing with DKT model |
| GPU Support | Basic AMReX | Enhanced operations for resolved particles |

## Sample Cases

- [Reversed Single Vortex (RSV)](./Tutorials/RSV/)

- [Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability](./Tutorials/RayleighTaylor_LS/)

- [Cluster of monodisperse particles](./Tutorials/Monodisperse/)

- [Two-dimensional traveling-wave fin (fiber)](./Tutorials/Fiber/)

- [Three-dimensional traveling-wave fin](./Tutorials/fin3d/)

The prescribed-fin implementations share the DIBM solver and are selected by
`DIM=2` or `DIM=3`. See the [integration notes](./Docs/Fin_Integration.md) for
input conventions, source provenance, and validation status.

For more details, please check the document: [sample-cases](https://ruohai0925.github.io/IAMReX/Introduction_Chapter.html#sample-cases)

## Installation

For detailed steps on downloading IAMReX, building and running the cases, see [Getting Started](https://ruohai0925.github.io/IAMReX/Getting_Started.html).

## State of the field

We made great efforts to simulate more complex multiphase flows at higher resolution using IAMReX. One effort is to combine the AMR technique with the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method to resolve particles only on the finest-level grid. It significantly reduces the grid requirements for particle-resolved simulation compared with commonly used uniform grid solvers [Incompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d), [CaNS](https://github.com/CaNS-World/CaNS), and [CP3d](https://github.com/GongZheng-Justin/CP3d). Additionally, we utilized a subcycling technique to alleviate the time step constraint on coarser levels. It minimizes the total time step needed by time advancement compared with the non-subcycling technique used in other AMR-related packages, such as [IBAMR](https://github.com/IBAMR/IBAMR.git), [basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/), and [incflo](https://github.com/AMReX-Fluids/incflo.git).
